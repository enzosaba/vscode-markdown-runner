## Features

- Toggle automatic pasting of results at the bottom of the code block within the settings.
- Select Python environments within the settings.
- Enable memory sharing, persistent execution, like in a Jupytrer notebook within the settings.
- Model keyboard shortcuts after jupyter notebook.
